Considering the present condition due to Covid-19, distant and remote learning has been of everyone's life. We wanted to give it a try from our end to address the issues faced by programmers in a simpler way.

Using the most powerful weapon with humanity - technology, we decided to solve the issue by introducing Codefry Application. It is a MernStack Web Application, based upon the user‚Äôs Codeforces profile handles, helps programmers to code together and eases their tasks in the online schedule.

<h2 align="left" id="Stepstofollow"> ‚≠ê Steps to follow :scroll:</h2>

<br>

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ Code of conduct

Please read our [Code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which stipulates explicitly that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This also documents our conflict resolution policy.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Codefry](https://github.com/lavishabhambri/CodeFry) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.
<br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to a local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Codefry.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `Codefry` repository in Github, move to that folder first using the change directory command on Linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder Codefry
$ cd Codefry
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Codefry.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Codefry.git (push)
```
Now, let‚Äôs add a reference to the original [Codefry](https://github.com/lavishabhambri/CodeFry) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/lavishabhambri/CodeFry.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeFry.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeFry.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/lavishabhambri/CodeFry.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/lavishabhambri/CodeFry.git (push)
```
<br>

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of the repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `Codefry` repo
$ git push origin master
```
<br>



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating [pull requests](https://github.com/lavishabhambri/CodeFry/pulls).

<br>

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to make a contribution. Please create a separate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with the name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b Folder_Name
```

Create a separate branch for contribution and try to use the same name of the branch as in the folder.

To switch to the desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout Folder_Name
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reviewer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

<br>


### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Share your work :star_struck:

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Folder_Name
```

Then, go to your repository in the browser and click on `compare and pull requests.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.
