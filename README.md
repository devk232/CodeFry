## Inspiration:
Considering the present condition due to Covid-19, distant and remote learning has been of everyone's life. We wanted to give it a try from our end to address the issues faced by programmers in a simpler way.

Using the most powerful weapon with humanity - technology, we decided to solve the issue by introducing Codefry Application. It is a MernStack Web Application, based upon the userâ€™s Codeforces profile handles, helps programmers to code together and eases their tasks in the online schedule.

 

## Technology Stack:
- **Frontend** - React <br>
- **Backend** - Express.js, Node.js <br>
- **Database** - MongoDB <br>
- **Other tools & technologies** - Web APIs, Socket.IO <br>


## Setup (APIs used)
Following APIs are required to run this web app:

- [Codeforces Problem Set API](https://codeforces.com/api/problemset.problems?tags=implementation)
- [Codeforces User Status API](https://codeforces.com/api/user.status?handle=Fefer_Ivan&from=1&count=10)
